    <H5>Hello, I'm Ryan Dawson. </H5>
    <B2> I am an artist and designer, outdoorsman,  life-long learner, and fashionista (as you can tell, from my profile image). I’ve been described as chaotic good, an enigma, and a cool dude.  I earned my bachelors degree in studio arts from Monmouth College, where I focused on Ceramics, Ceramic Engineering, and Photography. My background in art continues to inspire my everyday life, leading me to User Experience and User Interface Design, where I live in the realm of wireframe and aesthetic design. </B2>
